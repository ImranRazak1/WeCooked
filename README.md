This project has been archived. It was a great way to learn SwiftUI and build something with such a powerful framework, but now I am going to continue with my journey to build on iOS with UIKit and SwiftUI over the coming months.

WeDiscover, WeCreate, WeShare -- WeCooked.

Welcome to WeCooked, an app to help you discover new foods, create and share them with friends and family. Discover creators such as Joe Wicks, Mary Berry and Jamie Oliver with more being added. 

All attributes and Copyrights belong to the creators such as the recipe and image. 

We just want to make it easier to find good recipes that you can cook for your friends and families. 

The Main Branch is the released version of the app. The other branches are unreleased and are in development.
